# Using SEA
This repository demonstrates how you can use the `speech-experiment-accelerator` package to run experiment accelerators.

## Pre-requisits
You must have an AI Studio Project or an Azure Machine Learning workspace to use it. 

**NB->** This repository is meant to be used inside a compute instance, in either AI Studio or Azure Machine Learning. 

If you would like to run it locally, you will need extra configuration:

- An existing AI Studio / AML Workspace
- download the `config.json` file and place it in the target folder

## Using it
To run experiments, go to [1.sea-run.ipynb](./1%20using-sea-run/1.sea-run.ipynb)
